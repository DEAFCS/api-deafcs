-- A party is the set of free agents in one tournament sharing a party_id: the
-- id of the 5stack lobby they signed up from. Membership of that lobby is the
-- consent -- the lobby captain already queues the whole lobby into matchmaking,
-- so signing the same lobby up for a draft needs no second mechanism.

-- Caps a party at the tournament's team size. The draft places a party on ONE
-- team, so a party that cannot fit a team could never be honoured: it would sit
-- in the pool being skipped by every draft forever while its members believed
-- they were entered.
--
-- _agent_id is excluded from the count so an UPDATE that only moves a row
-- between parties is not measured against itself.
