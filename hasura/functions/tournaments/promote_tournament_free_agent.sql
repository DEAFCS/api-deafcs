-- Fills the vacated slots on a drafted pickup team from the waitlist. Returns
-- the promoted players' steam ids, or NULL when nothing was promoted.
--
-- Waitlisting used to be a one-way door: a drafted free agent who left took
-- their team below min_players_per_lineup, the team was dropped at seeding, and
-- the waitlisted players sat there while the bracket shrank.
--
-- SIGN-UP ORDER DECIDES, exactly like the draft's selection stage -- created_at
-- ascending, never ELO. The draft only lets ELO decide which team a selected
-- player lands on; letting it decide who plays at all is the one thing a
-- first-come pool must not do, and a promotion is a selection.
--
-- Returns an array rather than one id because the waitlist is made of UNITS: a
-- party promotes whole or not at all, so one call can fill more than one slot.
