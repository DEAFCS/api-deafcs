-- Turns a free agent pool into balanced pickup teams. Returns the number of
-- teams created.
--
-- Selection (who plays at all) is registration order alone and assignment
-- (which team) is ELO; merging them would let a late high-ELO signup take the
-- slot of someone who registered hours earlier. Both work on UNITS -- everyone
-- sharing a party_id, or a lone agent -- and a unit's priority is its EARLIEST
-- member's signup, so joining a party neither buys nor costs anyone a place.
