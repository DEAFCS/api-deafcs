// Reproduces the "duplicate key value violates unique constraint
// tournament_roster_pkey" error seen when adding a team to a tournament.
//
// tournament_roster_pkey is PRIMARY KEY (player_steam_id, tournament_id) — a
// player may be on only ONE team per tournament. The tai_tournament_team
// auto-fill path dedupes against the whole tournament to respect this, but it
// only runs when the client does NOT supply a roster. The web join form always
// sends an explicit nested roster.data, bypassing that guard, so a supplied
// player who is already rostered elsewhere in the tournament hits the PK.
